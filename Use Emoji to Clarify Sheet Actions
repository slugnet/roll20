Use Emoji to Clarify Sheet Actions
Not my original idea (thanks reddit user Emmia for this one!). Didn't see it in the thread anywhere else, so hopefully I'm not duplicating.

Using emoji, you can make features and actions (or really anything!) on your sheet more easy to parse at a glance. Requires a bit of manual work - just copy and paste them into the name of the item. This work goes pretty fast for an established sheet, I suggest trying to do all similar items in one pass so you don't have to switch what is in your copied clipboard.

While I think this is helpful to players, this is super helpful as the DM, as I'm less familiar with character options than most other functions in the game. So if I need to hop into a sheet to run for someone who is missing a session, or help troubleshoot, I can quickly see what options are available to me in my current game situation without toggling everything open.

This is the template I have started with (easily expand with whatever emoji you want, add multiple emoji for complex actions, whatever!), which I add at the top of the Features & Traits section as a cheat sheet:

❔ Action Colors
⚪ - Passive
🔵 - Action
🟡 - Bonus Action
🟢 - Movement
🔴 - Reaction
⚫ - Free Action
⏲️ - Spell with long cast time
